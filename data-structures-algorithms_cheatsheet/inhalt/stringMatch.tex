\section{String Matching}
{\tiny find all occurrences of pattern p (length m) in text t (length n) \\
The size of the alphabet (q) is often an important factor\\
p occurs in t with shift s if p[0:m] == t[s:s+m]\\
A string x is a prefix/suffix of string y, if y=xw/ y=wx for a possibly empty string w\\}\\
\scriptsize{Brute-force string search}\\ 
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{string-match.png}\\{\tiny Start from the beginning, of i = 0 and j = 0\\
-if j == m, announce success with s = i\\
-if t[i]! = p[j]: shift p (increase i, set j = 0)\\
-otherwise: compare the next character (increase i and j, repeat)\\
worst case: t: AAAAAAAAC, p: AAC}\\
\scriptsize{Boyer-Moore algorithm}\\
{\tiny start comparing from the end of p\\
If t[i] does not occur in p, shift m steps\\
Otherwise, align the last occurrence of t[i] in p with t[i]\\

2. all unspecified transitions go to state 0\\
3. when at the accepting state, announce success\\

\scriptsize{Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm}\\ {\tiny 1. in case of a match, increment both i and j\\
2. on failure, or at the end of the pattern, decide which new p[j] compare with t[i] based on a function f\\
3. f[j-1] tells which j value to resume the comparisons from\\

\scriptsize{Robin-Karp algorithm}\\ {\tiny 1. instead of matching the string itself, matching the hash of it (based on a hash function)\\
2. If a match found, we need to verify â€“ the match may be because of a hash collision\\
3. Otherwise, the algorithm makes a single comparison for each position in the text\\
a hash should be computed for each position (size m) (rolling hash functions avoid this complication)
}\\
\scriptsize{rolling hash function} {\tiny changes the hash value only based on the item coming in and going out of the window\\
to reduce collisions, better rolling-hash functions (e.g. polynomial hash functions) can be used
