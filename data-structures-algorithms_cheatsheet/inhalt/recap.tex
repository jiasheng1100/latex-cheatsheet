\section{Recap}
\scriptsize{Abstract Data Type (ADT)} {\tiny an object with well-defined operations, e.g. a stack supports push() and pop() operations \\
can be implemented using different data structures, e.g. a stack can be implemented using a linked list or an array}\\
\scriptsize{Array} {\tiny a contiguous sequence of
objects with the same size \\
close to how computers store data in their memory\\
can also be multi-dimensional\\
support fast access to their elements through indexing\\
resizing and inserting values in arbitrary locations are expensive\\
in python: no built-in data structure, lists are indexable, use numpy library for proper/faster arrays
}\\
\scriptsize{Lists}
{\tiny main operations: append/prepend, head/tail\\
typically implemented usingn linked lists (python lists are array-based)
}\\
\scriptsize{Stacks} {\tiny last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure\\
basic operations: push, pop\\
can be implemented using linked lists (or arrays)
}\\
\scriptsize{Queues} {\tiny first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure\\
basic operations: enqueue, dequeue\\
can be implemented using linked lists (or maybe arrays)
}\\
\scriptsize{Strings} {\tiny often implemented based on character arrays }\\
\scriptsize{Maps/Dictionaries} {\tiny similar to arrays and lists, but allow indexing with (almost) arbitrary data types\\
maps generally implemented using hashing }\\
\scriptsize{Sets} {\tiny implement the mathematical (finite) sets, a collection of unique elements without order}\\
\scriptsize{Algorithms}
{\tiny Desirable properties: correctness, robustness, efficiency, simplicity}\\
\scriptsize{Resursion}
{\tiny have to define one or more base cases\\
each recursive step should approach the base case}
