\section{Second-Order Logic}
{\scriptsize CR (CX: X is a predicate with the property of being a color; Rx: x is red) \\
$\exists X(CX \land Xm)$: Mars has a color. \\
$\exists X(Xj \land Xp)$: John has at least one thing in common with Peter. \\
$\forall x (\exists X ((AX \land Xx) \land Jx) \to \exists Y (Yx \land CY))$: All animals that live in the jungle have a color.\\
$\forall x (\exists X ((Xx \land AX) \land Gx) \to Ex)$: If an animal is grey, then it is an elephant.}
\subsection*{Vocabulary extention}
{\scriptsize 1st-order predicate variables: X, Y, Z\\
2nd-order predicate constants: A, B, C\\
e.g. AX: X is a property with the property of being an animal}
\subsection*{Syntax: Recursive Definition}
{\scriptsize (i) If A is an n-ary first-order predicate letter in the vocabulary of L, and each of t1,..., tn are individual terms in L, then At1,..., tn is an (atomic) formula in L.\\
(ii) If X is a [first-order] predicate variable and t is an individual term (both constants and variables) in L, then Xt is an atomic formula in L;\\
(iii) If A is an n-ary second-order predicate letter/constant in L, and
T1,...,Tn are first-order \textbf{unary} predicate constants, or predicate
variables, in L, then AT1,...,Tn is an (atomic) formula in L;\\
(iv) If $\phi$ is a formula in L, then $\neg \phi$ is too.\\
(v) If $\phi$ and $\psi$ are formulas in L, then $(\phi \land \psi), (\phi \lor \psi), (\phi \to \psi), (\phi \leftrightarrow \psi)$ are too.\\
(vii) If $\phi$ is a formula in L and x is a variable, then $\forall x \phi$ and $\exists x \phi$ is too.\\
(viii) If X is a [first-order] predicate variable, and $\phi$ is a formula in L, then $\forall X \phi$ and $\exists X \phi$ is too.\\
(viiii) Only that which can be generated by the clauses (i)-(vii) in a finite number of steps is a formula in L.\\}
invalid: $x, X, Xab, \forall(Xa)$
\subsection*{Semantics}
{\scriptsize just as a 1st-order predicate denotes a set of entities, a 2nd-order predicate denotes a set of a set of entities.}
