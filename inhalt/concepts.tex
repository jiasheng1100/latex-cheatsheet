\section{Fundamental Concepts}
\emph{Reference}: How does the mapping between form and meaning work? Does it work at all?\\
\emph{Compositionality}: How are
complex utterances built from
smaller units? Are they built
from smaller units at all?\\
\emph{Combinatorial structure}: a small number of meaningless building blocks (phonemes, parts of syllables) combined into an unlimited set of utterances (words and morphemes)\\
\emph{Compositional structure}: meaningful building blocks (words and morphemes) are combined into larger meaningful utterances (phrases and
sentences)
