\section{Fundamental Concepts}
\scriptsize{Reference} {\tiny How does the mapping between form and meaning work? Does it work at all?}\\
\scriptsize{Compositionality} {\tiny How are
complex utterances built from
smaller units? Are they built
from smaller units at all?}\\
\scriptsize{Combinatorial structure} {\tiny a small number of meaningless building blocks (phonemes, parts of syllables) combined into an unlimited set of utterances (words and morphemes)}\\
\scriptsize{Compositional structure} {\tiny meaningful building blocks (words and morphemes) are combined into larger meaningful utterances (phrases and sentences)}
